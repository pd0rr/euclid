    <h1>Euclid's elements, web version</h1>
    <p>This webpage follows the general scheme of Euclid's original work, while updating some of the terminology. Occasionally we might point out some of Euclid's inaccuracies, but we make no pretense to have a perfectly rigorous treatment; our main goal is ease of understanding for high school level students.</p>
    <h2>Primitive entities</h2>
    <p>Euclid defined these terms, but he never used these definitions. Therefore it's better to leave them undefined.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Point</li>
        <li>Segment</li>
        <li>Plane</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Note: we use the term "segment" instead of Euclid's "line".</em></p>
