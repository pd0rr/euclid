    <h1>Euclid's elements, web version</h1>
    <p>This webpage follows the general scheme of Euclid's original work, while updating some of the terminology. Occasionally we might point out some of Euclid's inaccuracies, but we make no pretense to have a perfectly rigorous treatment; our main goal is ease of understanding for high school level students.</p>

    <h2>Primitive entities</h2>
    <p>Euclid defined these terms, but he never used these definitions. Therefore it's better to leave them undefined.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Point</li>
        <li>Segment</li>
        <li>Plane</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Note: we use the term "segment" instead of Euclid's "line".</em></p>

    <h2>Primitive relationships</h2>
    These are also not explicitly declared by Euclid.
    <ol>
        <li>Congruence</li>
        <li>Incidence</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <p><strong>Angle</strong>: pair of lines that <em>contain</em> a common point.</p>
    <p><strong>Right angle</strong>: angle formed by two lines that form equal angles. The lines are called <em>perpendiculars</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Obtuse angle</strong>: an angle greater than a right angle.</p>
    <p><strong>Acute angle</strong>: an angle smaller than a right angle.</p>
    <p><strong>Circle</strong>: part of the plane contained by a circumference.</p>
    <p id="def-circumference"><strong>Circumference</strong>: the set of points that form <em>congruent</em> segments with a common point, called the <em>center</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Rectilinear figure</strong>: part of a plane contained by segments, called <strong>sides</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Triangle</strong>: rectilinear figure with 3 sides. A triangle can be: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Equilateral</strong> if it has 3 equal sides;</li>
        <li><strong>Isosceles</strong> if it has two equal sides;</li>
        <li><strong>Scalene</strong> if all the sides are different.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Quadrilateral</strong>: a rectilinear figure with 4 sides. Among these, we define:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a <strong>square</strong> has all right angles and congruent sides;</li>
        <li>a <strong>rectangle</strong> has all right angles but unequal sides;</li>
        <li>a <strong>rhombus</strong> has congruent sides, but not all right angles;</li>
        <li>a <strong>rhomboid</strong> or <strong>parallelogram</strong> has opposite sides and angles congruent to one another.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Parallel segments</strong> belong to the same plane but any of their <em>extensions</em> don't have any points in common.</p>

    <h2>Postulates</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A pair of points defines a segment.</li>
        <li id="post-2">A segment can always be extended.</li>
        <li id="post-3">A circle with any center and radius exists (can be drawn).</li>
        <li>All right angles are congruent to each other.</li>
        <li>If a segment crosses two other segments and the <strong>sum</strong> of two angles on the same side is less than two right angles, then there exist extensions of the two segments that meet in a point on the same side; there's no such point on the other side.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Common notions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li id="comm-1">Congruence is a transitive relationship.</li>
        <li>Given two pairs of congruent things, the sums across the pairs are congruent to each other.</li>
        <li id="comm-3">Given two pairs of congruent things, the differences across pairs are equal to each other.</li>
        <li id="comm-4">Congruence is a reflexive relationship.</li>
        <li id="comm-5">The whole is greater than the part.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Propositions</h2>

        <li>Since A is the center of circle CDB and AC and AB are it's radiuses, AC and AB are congruent (definition of <a href="#def-circumference">circumference</a>)</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Suppose that the thesis is false (reductio ad absurdum): if AB and AC are not congruent, then one must be larger than the other (<em>Note: here Euclid is assuming an order relationship between segments that constitutes an implicit axiom</em>)</li>
        <li>Without loss of generality, assume AB > AC (if this is not the case, the points should be relabeled to make it happen).</li>
        <li>Construct the point D on AB such that DB &cong; AC (using <a href="#prop-3">proposition 3</a>.</li>
        <li>Draw the segment DC (<a href="#post-1">postulate 1</a>).</li>
        <li>DB &cong; AC (by construction), BC &cong; CB (by <a href="#comm-4">common notion 4</a>) and the angles DBC &cong; ACB. Thus by <a href="#prop-4">proposition 4</a>, we have the triangles DBC &cong; ACB.</li>
        <li>But by <a href="#comm-5">common notion 5</a>, the part cannot be greater than the whole (<em>Euclid is a bit generic here. What does he mean exactly by part?</em>), therefore we have arrived at a contradiction.</li>
        <li>Thus AB is not unequal to AC; therefore AB &cong; AC. <strong>QED</strong></li>

    <h3 id="prop-7">Proposition 7</h3>
    <p>Given a segment, it's not possible to build two different triangles (on the same side of the initial element) with congruent sides that will converge in a different vertex.</p>
    <p><em>Note: Euclid only examines the non-trivial case where the triangles don't contain each other. When they do, common notion 5 gives an easy contradiction.</em></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Draw segment CD (<a href="#post-1">postulate 1</a>).</li>
        <li>AC &cong; AD; thus by <a href="prop-5">proposition 5</a>, then angles ACD &cong; ADC.</li>
        <li>By <a href="comm-5">common notion 5</a>, angles ACD > DCB (<em>if it isn't, exchange the labels</em>).</li>
        <li>Putting together the previous points, we have ADC > DCB.</li>
        <li>Similarly, CDB > DCB.</li>
        <li>By definition, CB &cong; DB; therefore by <a href="prop-5">proposition 5</a>, the angles CDB &cong; DCB.</li>
        <li>We have proved that CDB > DCB, but also that CDB &cong; DCB. This is a contradiction!</li>

    <h3>Proposition 8</h3>
