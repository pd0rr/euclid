    <h1>Euclid's elements, web version</h1>
    <p>This webpage follows the general scheme of Euclid's original work, while updating some of the terminology. Occasionally we might point out some of Euclid's inaccuracies, but we make no pretense to have a perfectly rigorous treatment; our main goal is ease of understanding for high school level students.</p>

    <h2>Primitive entities</h2>
    <p>Euclid defined these terms, but he never used these definitions. Therefore it's better to leave them undefined.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Point</li>
        <li>Segment</li>
        <li>Plane</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Note: we use the term "segment" instead of Euclid's "line".</em></p>

    <h2>Primitive relationships</h2>
    These are also not explicitly declared by Euclid.
    <ol>
        <li>Congruence</li>
        <li>Incidence</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <p><strong>Angle</strong>: pair of lines that <em>contain</em> a common point.</p>
    <p id="def-rightangle"><strong>Right angle</strong>: angle formed by two lines that form equal angles. The lines are called <em>perpendiculars</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Obtuse angle</strong>: an angle greater than a right angle.</p>
    <p><strong>Acute angle</strong>: an angle smaller than a right angle.</p>
    <p><strong>Circle</strong>: part of the plane contained by a circumference.</p>
    <p id="def-circumference"><strong>Circumference</strong>: the set of points that form <em>congruent</em> segments with a common point, called the <em>center</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Rectilinear figure</strong>: part of a plane contained by segments, called <strong>sides</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Triangle</strong>: rectilinear figure with 3 sides. A triangle can be: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Equilateral</strong> if it has 3 equal sides;</li>
        <li><strong>Isosceles</strong> if it has two equal sides;</li>
        <li><strong>Scalene</strong> if all the sides are different.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Quadrilateral</strong>: a rectilinear figure with 4 sides. Among these, we define:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a <strong>square</strong> has all right angles and congruent sides;</li>
        <li>a <strong>rectangle</strong> has all right angles but unequal sides;</li>
        <li>a <strong>rhombus</strong> has congruent sides, but not all right angles;</li>
        <li>a <strong>rhomboid</strong> or <strong>parallelogram</strong> has opposite sides and angles congruent to one another.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Parallel segments</strong> belong to the same plane but any of their <em>extensions</em> don't have any points in common.</p>

    <h2>Postulates</h2>
    <ol>
        <li id="post-1">A pair of points defines a segment.</li>
        <li id="post-2">A segment can always be extended.</li>
        <li id="post-3">A circle with any center and radius exists (can be drawn).</li>
        <li>All right angles are congruent to each other.</li>
        <li>If a segment crosses two other segments and the <strong>sum</strong> of two angles on the same side is less than two right angles, then there exist extensions of the two segments that meet in a point on the same side; there's no such point on the other side.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Common notions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li id="comm-1">Congruence is a transitive relationship.</li>
        <li>Given two pairs of congruent things, the sums across the pairs are congruent to each other.</li>
        <li id="comm-3">Given two pairs of congruent things, the differences across pairs are equal to each other.</li>
        <li id="comm-4">Congruence is a reflexive relationship.</li>
        <li id="comm-5">The whole is greater than the part.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Proposition 14</h3>
    <p>If two segments have a common extreme with a third segment, lie on opposite sides of it, and form adjacent angles whose sum equals two right angles, then the first two segments are extensions of each other.</p>

<div class="proof">
    <p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: Let BC and BD form angles ABC and ABD with AB; ABC + ABD equals two right angles.</p>
    <p><strong>Thesis</strong>: BD and CB are extensions of each other.</p>
    <p><strong>Proof</strong>:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Assume that BD is not an extension of BC (<em>reductio ad absurdum</em>).</li>
        <li>Construct BE as the extension of BC (<a href="#post-2">postulate 2</a>).</li>
        <li>Since AB stands on the segment CBE, by <a href="#prop-13">proposition 13</a> we have angles ABC + ABE equal two right angles.</li>
        <li>By hypothesis, ABC + ABD equals two right angles, and we just proved that ABC + ABE equals the same thing; thus by <a href="#comm-1">C. N. 1</a>, ABC + ABD = ABC + ABE.</li>
        <li>Subracting ABC from both sides, we have from <a href="#comm-3">C. N. 3</a> that ABD = ABE.</li>
        <li>But by <a href="#comm-5">C. N. 5</a>, this is impossible.</li>
        <li>Since we have arrived at a contradiction, we can conclude that we can't construct an extension of CB that is distinct from BD.</li>
        <li>Therefore BD is the extension of CB. <strong>QED</strong></li>

    <div class="proof">

        <p><strong>Proof</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Since segment AE has an extreme on CD, the angles CEA and AED it forms equal two straight angles when summed (<a href="#prop-13">proposition 13</a>).</li>
